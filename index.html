            Hello, I'm Alyssa June! I earned my B.S. in Neuroscience from the University of Texas at Austin.
            In my coursework, I realized I had a love for quantitative thinking resulting in the addition of two minors to my degree:
            Elements of Computing and Applied Statistical Modeling.

            Neuroscience
            <br> <p class = "plain">
            In my Neuroscience degree, I have learned the processes that are responsible for how the
            central and peripheral nervous systems function. The study of neuroscience is multidisciplinary
            and has tested my knowledge of chemistry, physics, genetics, animal behavior, mathematical models, and cell physiology.

            Within my Elements of Computing minor, I have learned how to make different apps, software, and websites.
            The classes I've taken have put an emphasis on how to work with others using agile XP and waterfall methodologies.
            Below are the different courses I have taken and the main programming language(s) used in the class.

            Applied Statistical Modeling
            <br> <p class = "plain">
            The Applied Statistical Modeling minor has taught me how to accurately and truthfully interpret statistical output.
            Every course I have taken for this minor has utilized R and RStudio to visualize data and run statistical analysis on data.
            I have done analyses using single, multiple, interaction, mediation, segmented, logistic, and multinomial/ordinal regression
            in my coursework. One of my favorite classes in this minor laid the foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning methods
            and their applications to the real world. We went over classification, non-linear regression, tree-based models, and support
            vector machines.
